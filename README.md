# mini-ml-project-lavi
Logistic Regression implemented from scratch in Python (NumPy)
Manual implementation of logistic regression

Sigmoid function, loss computation, and gradient descent

Feature normalization and bias term handling

Accuracy evaluation without prebuilt ML libraries
Key Steps

Data Loading: Load and clean the dataset using pandas.

Preprocessing: Normalize input features for stable convergence.

Model Building: Implement the logistic regression formula manually.

Optimization: Apply gradient descent to minimize loss.

Evaluation: Compare predicted outcomes with true labels.
